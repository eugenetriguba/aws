Public Cloud

* Cloud environment that is available to the public (i.e. AWS, Azure, Google Cloud).

Private Cloud

* Run from business premises (i.e. AWS Outposts, Azure Stack, Anthos).
* Massive difference between running on-premise infrastructure (i.e. VMware) and having a private cloud because a private cloud still needs to meet the 5 characteristics of cloud computing whereas most on-premise infrastructure does not.

Hybrid Cloud

* Using a private and public cloud and cooperating as a single environment.
* Not to be confused with a hybrid environment, where one part of the stack runs in a Cloud and another runs on existing on-premise infrastructure.

Multi Cloud

* Using multiple public cloud environments (i.e. AWS + Azure) to provide cloud provider level resilience to provide high availability.
* Avoid single pane views that allow you manage them all as one environment, since it forces you to rely on the lowest common feature sets.
