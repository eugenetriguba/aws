Definition (from NIST i.e. National Institute of Standards and Technology)

* NIST Special Publication 800-145 : [https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/Legacy/SP/nistspecialpublication800-145.pdf](https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/Legacy/SP/nistspecialpublication800-145.pdf)

## Key Characteristics

On-Demand Self-Service

* Can provision capabilities (i.e. storage, databases, etc.) as needed without requiring human interaction

Broad Network Access

* Capabilities are available over the network and accessed through standard mechanisms (HTTP, HTTPS, SSH, etc.).

Resource Pooling:

* There is a sense of location independence...no control or knowledge over the exact location of the resources.
* ...Resources are pooled to serve multiple consumers using a multi-tenant model.

Rapid Elasticity

* Capabilities can be elastically provisioned and released to scale rapidly outward and inward with demand (i.e system load).
* To the consumer, the capabilities available for the provisioning often appear to be unlimited.

Measured Service

* Resource usage can be monitored, controlled, reported, ... and billed (pay for what you consume).
