* Dockerfile are used to build images
* Portable - self-contained, always run as expected
* Lightweight - Parent OS used, fs layers are shared.
* Container only runs the application & environment it needs.
* Provides much of the isolation VM's do
* Ports are "exposed" to the host and beyond..
* Application stacks can be multi-container
