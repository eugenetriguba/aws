Serverless that is not one single thing (software architecture rather than hardware architecture).

* Event-driven
  * Consumption only when being used.
  * FaaS is used where possible for compute functionality.
* Micro-services
  * Applications are a collection of small and specialized functions 
    (lambda).

You manage few, if any servers - low overhead.

Stateless and Ephemeral environments (duration billing). Generally no persistent usage of compute.

Managed services are used where possible.
